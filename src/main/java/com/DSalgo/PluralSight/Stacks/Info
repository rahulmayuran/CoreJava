The examples provided here (StackDataStructure and CardStackApp) are just a representation of how stack works.

Exercise :

1. Create an interface called Stack which has the methods like push(X var), pop(), size()
contains(X var) and access(X var)

2. Let it be implemented with two classes namely BasicStack and the ListStack which is an
ArrayList implementation.

Apart from creating your own data structures, The Real core Java developers have implemented
Stack and Deque operations already. Go through it.
